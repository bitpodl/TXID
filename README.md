> The "bitcoin-txid" repoasitory is a comprehensive collection of resources, tools and documentation focused on transaction identification (TXID) on the Bitcoin blockchain.

A TXID (transaction ID) is a unique alphanumeric string assigned to a specific transaction in the Bitcoin blockchain. This ID acts as a unique fingerprint or identifier for a transaction and allows it to be uniquely identified.

The TXID is generated by entering the transaction data, such as sender, recipient, amount and other important information, into a hashing algorithm. This process creates a cryptographic hash function that generates a fixed length and a unique string of characters. A TXID typically consists of 64 hexadecimal characters.

TXIDs are crucial for tracking and identifying transactions in the blockchain. They serve as a reference point for proving a transaction and are often used to retrieve or verify transaction details.
