# TX-ID

A TXID (transaction ID) is a unique alphanumeric string assigned to a specific transaction in the Bitcoin blockchain. This ID acts as a unique fingerprint or identifier for a transaction and allows it to be uniquely identified.

The TXID is generated by entering the transaction data, such as sender, recipient, amount and other important information, into a hashing algorithm. This process creates a cryptographic hash function that generates a fixed length and a unique string of characters. A TXID typically consists of 64 hexadecimal characters.

TXIDs are crucial for tracking and identifying transactions in the blockchain. They serve as a reference point for proving a transaction and are often used to retrieve or verify transaction details.

## TX-Construction

A transaction ID (TXID) in the Bitcoin blockchain is generated by applying a cryptographic hash algorithm to the transaction data. Here is a rough overview of how a TXID is structured:

1. **Transaction data:**
  - Each Bitcoin transaction consists of various data fields, including:
    - The input information, which specifies which Bitcoin addresses the BTC come from.
    - The output information, which defines where the BTC are sent to and in what quantities.
    - Additional information such as the fee used and other metadata.
    - Creation of the hash: The transaction data is entered as input into a cryptographic hash function. Bitcoin essentially uses the SHA-256 hash function (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit) for this.

2. **Hash result:**
  - The hash algorithm then generates a cryptographic hash value from the transaction data. This hash value has a fixed length and is referred to as the transaction ID (TXID).

4. **Length and format:**
  - The TXID is a hexadecimal string with a length of 64 characters (or 256 bits). These characters consist of the digits 0-9 and the letters a-f.

6. **Uniqueness:**
  - The TXID is a unique identifier for a specific transaction in the blockchain. Even a slight change in the transaction data would generate a completely different hash value and therefore a completely different TXID.
